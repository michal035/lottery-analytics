# Lottery Analytics

This is a project focused on lottery analytics for the "lotto" lottery. Here, you can find spiders that collect data using Scrapy, data cleaning and separation tools with Pandas, analytics and graphs using Pandas and Seaborn (aka Matplotlib), and prediction tools using Tensorflow (currently in the making).

## Contents of this Project

This project contains the following tools:

- Spiders that collect data (Scrapy)
- Data cleaning and separation tools (Pandas)
- Analytics and graphs tools (Pandas and Seaborn aka Matplotlib)
- Prediction tools (Tensorflow) - currently in the making 

The combination of these tools allows you to gather and clean data, analyze it using various graphs and visualization tools, and make predictions using machine learning algorithms in Tensorflow.

## Usage

To use this project, you will need to have Python and the necessary libraries installed on your machine. You can install the necessary libraries by running the following command:

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

The result of the analytics provides information on how often each number occurred and the time since one of the numbers was picked. This information can help you to make informed decisions when choosing numbers for future lottery draws.
